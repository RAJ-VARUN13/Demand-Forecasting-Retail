# Demand Forecasting for Retail Store

## Project Overview
This project develops a time series forecasting model to predict product demand for a retail store, considering seasonality and trends for CodeClause Internship.

## Project Details
- **Project ID**: #CC69852
- **Domain**: Data Science Intern
- **Level**: Intermediate Level
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Algorithms**: SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## Project Aim
Develop a time series forecasting model to predict the demand for products in a retail store using historical sales data, considering seasonality and trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** - Understand the dataset structure
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle dates and prepare time series data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Identify trends and seasonal patterns
4. **Train-Test Split** - Split data for model validation
5. **SARIMA Modeling** - Build seasonal time series forecasting model
6. **Model Evaluation** - Calculate MAE, MSE, RMSE metrics
7. **Future Forecasting** - Predict demand for next 12 months

## Key Features
- Time series visualization and decomposition
- Seasonal pattern analysis
- SARIMA model implementation
- Future demand forecasting
- Performance metrics evaluation

## Results
- Successfully identified seasonal patterns in retail data
- Built SARIMA model with configurable parameters
- Generated future demand forecasts with confidence intervals
- Achieved reasonable prediction accuracy on test data

## How to Run
1. Open `Demand_Forecasting_Retail_Store.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. The code will automatically download sample data and generate forecasts
